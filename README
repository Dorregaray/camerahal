The Kitkat camera wrapper for HP TouchPad running 3.x kernel
----------------

The camera wrapper uses ION for memory allocations but still relies on
proprietary Qualcomm camera libs that depends on PMEM - the kernel must
support ION and PMEM ADSP allocators (~6MB is enough for PMEM ADSP).

This is the development branch. Use cm-11-ion for daily basis.
