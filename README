This is the ICS camera wrapper for tenderloin's  binary libcamera

----------------

Instructions

1. You need to have the CM9 sources patched with several patches from
   gerrit. Use the following script to patch the sources:
   http://pastebin.com/8igJK9WF

2. Download the camerahal sources to the ~/android/system/device/hp/tenderloin
   directory.  

3. Patch the BoardConfig.mk and device_tenderloin.mk with the following 
   changes: http://pastebin.com/g0YaimdL (do not add libcamera2 to the 
   PRODUCT_PACKAGES unless you want it to build it from sources too).

4. Obtain the libcamera.so and liboemcamera.so from CM7a2.1 build and replace
   the ones from CM9 in: ~/android/system/vendor/hp/tenderloin/proprietary/lib
   The libraries used in CM9 are incorrect and won't load thus there's need to
   use the proper ones from CM7.

5. Run "make clean" before running the first build.

6. Run "brunch tenderloin" to make a build.
